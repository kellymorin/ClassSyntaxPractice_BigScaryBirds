# JavaScript Class Syntax: Big Scary Birds
> The learning objective for this practice exercise is to use the class syntax to establish a reusable definition (i.e. blueprint) of the properties and methods that objects will have in an application.

Your job is to create a large, flightless bird class that defines the properties of a feathered terror. It should have the following properties:

* height
* flightless (should always be true)
* isExtinct
* name
* running speed

toString -- This will be a method that outputs a description of the bird based on some of its properties. 

Example output: `"The Cassowary is a big, scary bird that stands up to 6 ft and can run up to 30 mph!"`

Create at least 3 instances of the class.
